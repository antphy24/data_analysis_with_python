# Data Analysis with Python

This repository contains three lab modules from Data Analysis with Python course provided by IBM through Cognitive Class. All the modules were rewritten using my own understanding and preference from the original ones.

The lab modules are:
- Exploratory Data Analysis
- Model Development
- Model Evaluation and Refinement
